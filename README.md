# The Impact of Race, Gender, First-gen Status, Sleep Amount, and Institution Type on the Academic Performance of College Students
by Wale

## Summary
This project aims to answer the question of what factors influence academic performance, specifically GPA, for college students at three different institutions. The data was originally collected with participants being first-year students, where each participant was given a device to track their sleep for a month in the spring term of years 2016 to 2019, and demographic data was provided by university registrars. The team fit a logistic regression model to see which predictors best explain the odds of having a GPA above the 75th percentile using factors that were found to be significant after drop-in deviance tests.
